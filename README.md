# CheckSplit
Simple App that calculates how much each person pays to split a check, including tip. 
I looked over Hacking with Swift's tutorial on the WeSplit app for guidance and added some of my own functionality for styling, working withdates, etc.
Filenames include 'AddictionCounter' but this was a mistake in the creation of the Xcode Project.
